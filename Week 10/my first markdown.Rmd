```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# good for setup, like loading libraries

# This sets echo = TRUE for every chunk

# Introduction
## R Markdown

In every code chunk, you need to start with 'r'.

# Methods

Describe the methods

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Names for chunks are optional

heart = read.csv("Data/heart.csv")
 dim(heart)

```
There are `r nrow(heart)`. patients in the data set

## Running analyses

we testd if people with heart disease have a different maximum HR induced by exercise vs. peopel without heart dise


```{r}

tt_result = t.test(max_hr ~ disease, data = heart)

tt_result


```

The t test resulted in a p-value of `r tt_result$p.value` . There is a strong difference between the two groups.

## Visuals

```{r}
# Let's make a boxplot

heart$disease = facto

```

### ggplot 2 notes

**Example** Does max_hr also vary with sex?

```{r}
ggplot(data = heart, aes(x= disease, y = max_hr, fill = sex)) +geom_boxplot()
load(â€œNSDUH_2019.rData")

```
