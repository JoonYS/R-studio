# Note
v2 - Added 3 point bonus question at the end, and a few hints to Q3.

# Problem Set
## Q1 (5 points)

**Read the whole question before starting.** 
Convert the following 'for' loop to a 'while' loop.

```{r}

# Do not edit this block.
# You can run this block using the 'play' button to see the result.

vec <- seq(3, 30, by = 3)
for (i in vec) {
  print(i)
}

```

Here's the code I've written to get you started.  What's missing? Add something 
so that this loop has the same result as the 'for' loop above.

```{r}

# Edit this block.
# Remember to use the 'stop' button or ESC key if you need to make it stop running.

j <- 3
while (j <= 30) {
  print(j)
  j = j+3
}

```


## Q2 (10 points)

**This is a classic question in data science & computer programming job interviews.**

For every integer from 1 to 100, print one of the following things:
- Print "Fizz" if the integer is odd,
- Print "Buzz" if the integer is divisible by 5,
- Print "FizzBuzz" if the integer is odd and divisible by 5.
- Just print the integer if it is neither of those things.

```{r}
# Hint: Remember, 'X %% Y' gives you the remainder after dividing X by Y.
for (x in 1:100){
  if (x %% 5==0 & x %% 2==1){
    print("fizzbuzz")
  } else if (x %% 5==0){
    print("buzz")
  } else if (x %% 2==1){
    print ("fizz")
  }
}

```


## Q3 (10  points)

Read in the "Immunotherapy.csv" data set. Using a 'for' loop, print the 
median for every numeric column.  If you import the data from the 'Files' window,
you might need to change 'read_csv' to 'read.csv' to make the rest work (like
the in-class code).

**Bonus (2 points)** Also, print a `table` of each character/factor column.

```{r}
for (i in 1: ncol(Immunotherapy)){
    if(class(Immunotherapy[,i])== "numeric"| class(Immunotherapy[,i])== "integer"){
      print(median(Immunotherapy[,i]))
    }## Bonus
else if(class(Immunotherapy[,i])== "character"| class(Immunotherapy[,i])== "factor"){
      print(table(Immunotherapy[,i]))
}}



```


## Bonus (3 points)

Write a 'while' loop that will figure out if any number `num` is prime.

```{r}
# Remember, if you copy code from the internet, post a link to your source
# and add comments to explain what each part of the code is doing.


```
